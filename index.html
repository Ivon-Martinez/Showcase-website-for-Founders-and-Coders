          <p class="aboutMe">
            Hola! I’m Ivon. I studied Computer Science in Cuba and later worked in different roles, from software to international policy and student services. After moving to London and taking a break for maternity leave, I decided to return to tech and focus on building solutions that people can use and interact with.
            <br><br>

            I want to become a web developer because it combines creativity with logical thinking. I enjoy the challenge of turning an idea into something practical and engaging. I have always been the kind of girl who loves Sudoku and helping others find solutions to practical issues around the house or on their computers. I’m motivated by the opportunity to keep learning, collaborate with others, and contribute to projects that have a positive impact.
            <br><br>

            Joining the tech industry while taking care of a toddler, studying, and managing house chores hasn’t been a smooth path. The opportunity to join Founders & Coders excites me because of the structured guidance it offers. I believe this program will provide the perfect environment to update my skills and gain more hands-on experience needed to return to the industry confidently. I love how Founders & Coders is community-driven and has a collaborative approach, which matches how I learn best.
            <br><br>

            So far, I have been learning and practicing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. I have also recently started learning Python and strengthening my knowledge of SQL through a previous tech program. I volunteer as a web developer, full-stack and social media lead for different organizations to gain practical experience while helping others. I participate in mentorships with Meta, attend different tech workshops, and even created a tech study group with some colleagues from the Sky “Get Into Tech” program, where we study together and try to build projects collaboratively.
            <br><br>

            When I'm not coding, you’ll find me dancing, especially salsa, one of the main dances from my home country. I also love spending time with my family and friends, and teaching Spanish.
